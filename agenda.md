- Grading policy
  - This isn’t school, we want everyone to learn a lot.  There is no accredited finishing point where we want everyone to be.  Teams will be grouped with similar skill level.
  - We will be assessing your work weekly for completion, and then providing a full report to companies on your competency and effort levels at the end of class. Motivation is directly to yourself and getting the internship.
  - Think of this as an extended interview
- Assignments
  - Expected to complete all required assignments
  - No need to talk about cheating. You are here for your own benefit, and your professional reputation is on the line.

  - Google it! Spend at least 5 minutes searching the web, trying different queries. (StackOverflow.com, Developer.Mozilla.org, and GitHub.com are your friends. W3Schools.com isn’t, just reference W3Fools.com)
  - Slack your classmates. Try the “#questions” channel first. Search the channel first to see if the question has already come up. If not, go ahead and ask it!
  - Slack your instructors and TAs.
- GitHub Assignment Expectations
  - assignments are graded out of your GitHub repo
  - fork the IgnitionBoulder/2015week1 repo
  - all of your work for the first week can be done in GitHub (no need to clone, unless you want to)
  - SublimeText, the browser, and command line can help
  - only modify/add files in the deliverables folder.  Include everything on the README.md in that folder: links, images, content, even links to other files in that folder that you want us to see.
  - all assignments are due by class on Monday 6pm (must be committed to your repo on GH)
  - assignments are graded for effort, competence, and improvement
  - if you don’t finish everything by Monday, it’s still possible to get credit by turning it in by that Thursday, or any time before the end of the course
  - next week we will start using Cloud9 for dev env with Rails
